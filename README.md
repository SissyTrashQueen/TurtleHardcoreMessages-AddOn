# TurtleHardcoreMessages-AddOn
<<I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS ADDON IS STILL WORKING IN TURTLEWOW VERSION 1.17+>>

<< This addon does very little. Takes the SYSTEM messages broadcasted to the world, rewrites it to be less verbose, and shows only the 'valuable' information. Also makes all player's names into CLINKs/Chat Links for some extra legibility. >>

<< I've recorded the existence of all these messages: >>

AnyName has reached level 10 in Hardcore mode! Their ascendance towards immortality continues, however, so do the dangers they will face.

AnyName has reached level 20 in Hardcore mode! Their ascendance towards immortality continues, however, so do the dangers they will face.

AnyName has reached level 30 in Hardcore mode! Their ascendance towards immortality continues, however, so do the dangers they will face.

AnyName has reached level 40 in Hardcore mode! Their ascendance towards immortality continues, however, so do the dangers they will face.

AnyName has reached level 50 in Hardcore mode! Their ascendance towards immortality continues, however, so do the dangers they will face.

AnyName has transcended death and reached level 60 on Hardcore mode without dying once! Anyname shall henceforth be known as the Immortal!

AnyName has laughed in the face of death in the Hardcore challenge. AnyName has begun the Inferno Challenge!

A tragedy has occurred. Hardcore character AnyName has fallen to NPCName (level 40) at level 1. May this sacrifice not be forgotten.

A tragedy has occurred. Hardcore character AnyName has fallen in PvP to PlayerName at level 20. May this sacrifice not be forgotten.

A tragedy has occurred. Hardcore character AnyName died of natural causes at level 7. May this sacrifice not be forgotten.

A tragedy has occurred. Inferno character has fallen to NPCName (level 63) at level 60. They laughed in the face of death, but have learnt that death always has the last laugh.

<< AnyName, NPCName, (level), PlayerName and 'at level' can vary wildly. >>

<< I've never seen any of the messages below, but I suppose they do exist. Just extremely rare to see. >>

<< This whole AddOn can be rewritten easily to be a SYSTEM Hardcore messages filter, but there's already an ingame command for it (.hc messages/.hcm). Still I think the solution I've come up to is way more elegant than those options. >>
